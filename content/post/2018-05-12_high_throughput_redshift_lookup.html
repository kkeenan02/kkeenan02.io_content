<p>Recently, I had a seemingly simple task, where I effectively wanted to lookup a large list of value pairs in a large redshift table containing ~5 billion rows. I immediatly recalled that the <code>IN</code> clause would probably be useful here. Below is a mock example of how this approach might look:</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>select val_1, val_2, tablefield_1, tablefield_2, ..., tablefield_n
from target_table
where (val1, val2) IN ((value_1, value_1), (value_, value_2), ... (value_n, value_n))</code></pre>
