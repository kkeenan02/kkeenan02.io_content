```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Recently, I had a seemingly simple task, where I effectively wanted to lookup a large list of value pairs in a large redshift table containing ~5 billion rows. I immediatly recalled that the `IN` clause would probably be useful here. Below is a mock example of how this approach might look:

```sql
select val_1, val_2, tablefield_1, tablefield_2, ..., tablefield_n
from target_table
where (val1, val2) IN ((value_1, value_1), (value_, value_2), ... (value_n, value_n))
```
